This project focuses on the development and simulation of an autonomous UAV control system by integrating the PX4 autopilot firmware with Microsoft AirSim, a photorealistic, physics-based simulation platform. Communication between the flight controller and simulator is achieved via the MAVLink protocol, enabling seamless data exchange for telemetry, sensor feedback, and control commands. The system leverages ROS (Robot Operating System) for high-level mission planning, path following, and computer vision-based navigation using onboard virtual sensors such as LiDAR, GPS, and stereo cameras. Through this setup, advanced autonomy features—including offboard control, object detection, and obstacle avoidance—are developed and validated in a controlled virtual environment before real-world deployment.
